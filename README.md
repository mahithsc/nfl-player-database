# nfl-player-database

As part of my NFL take on wordlem I needed a complete list of all the starting offensize skill players on over team which can easily stay up to date. To achieve this easily, I used puppeteer, and nodeJS to create a simple script which will use the ESPN website to scrape all the current starting player from thde depth cahrt.

When run this script will write to a JSON file different metrics about the player such as height, age, team, position, and jersy number.
